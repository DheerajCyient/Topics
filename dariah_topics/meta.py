    Extracts basic metadata filenames.

    Args:
       glob_pattern (str): A glob pattern matching the files to list, cf. glob.glob
       fn_pattern (re.Regex): A regular expression that extracts metadata fields from the files' base name.
           The pattern must contain named groups (which have the form `(?<name>pattern)`, where name is
           the name of the metadata field and pattern is the part of the re matching this field name).

           the _ to the `author` field and everything after to the `title` field.
       index (str): Name of the column that will be used as index column. If None, an artificial index
           (integers, starting at 0) will be used.
